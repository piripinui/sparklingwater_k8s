# This service is used for communications between the Spark master and any workers. In the worker
# deployment configuration below the name of this service is used as the address for the SPARK_MASTER_HOST
# environment variable which tells the workers which service they should contact to register themselves with
# the master. Doing it this way avoids having the workers needing to know the specific hostname or IP
# address of the master pod, which may change if the master pod crashes or restarts.
